# InstantDB to MySQL migration

The supported cutover command exports every InstantDB entity and relationship to an encrypted local file, imports that snapshot into MySQL in one transaction, and verifies exact table counts and IDs before committing.

The export covers `AppSettings`, users, inventory and attributes, suppliers, customers and addresses, orders, wiggers, products, inventory/product audits, receipts, delivery attempts, delivery locks, and all corresponding links.

## Prerequisites

1. Run `yarn migration:run` so the MySQL schema exists.
2. Configure `INSTANT_APP_ID`, `INSTANT_ADMIN_TOKEN`, and all `DB_*` variables in `.env`.
3. Configure either `BACKUP_PASSWORD` or `BACKUP_PASSWORD_FILE`. A password file avoids placing the encryption password in shell history:

```bash
mkdir -p backup
umask 077
openssl rand -hex 32 > backup/.instantdb-backup-key
export BACKUP_PASSWORD_FILE=backup/.instantdb-backup-key
```

The entire `backup/` directory is ignored by Git. Keep both the encrypted snapshot and its password file in a separate secure location after migration.

## Commands

Create an encrypted InstantDB snapshot without changing MySQL:

```bash
yarn instant:backup
```

Import a previously generated snapshot:

```bash
yarn instant:import ./backup/instantdb_YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SS-MMMZ.json
```

Export first and then import that exact in-memory snapshot:

```bash
yarn instant:migrate
```

The import is repeatable for the same snapshot. It upserts stable IDs and rebuilds `InventoryItemAttribute`. It intentionally requires MySQL to contain exactly the imported IDs at verification time; unexpected extra rows cause a rollback instead of silently producing a mixed dataset.

## Legacy InstantDB restore

The older commands below restore an encrypted snapshot back into InstantDB. They are retained for rollback only and are not the MySQL migration path.

# Backup & Restore Utility

Standalone script for backing up and restoring all InstantDB data.

## Features

- ✅ Backs up all entities (AppSettings, Users, Orders, Customers, etc.)
- ✅ Preserves all relationships/links between entities
- ✅ **AES-256-GCM encryption** for backup files
- ✅ Timestamped backup files with date and time
- ✅ Safe restore process with 3-second warning
- ✅ Batch processing for large datasets

## Prerequisites

Add `BACKUP_PASSWORD` to your `.env` file:

```env
BACKUP_PASSWORD=your-secure-password-here
```

⚠️ **Important**: Keep this password safe! You cannot restore backups without it.

## Usage

### Create a Backup

**Option 1: Via API (Recommended for production)**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/backup
```

Or using fetch:
```javascript
fetch('http://localhost:3000/backup', { method: 'POST' })
  .then(res => res.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data));
```

Response:
```json
{
  "message": "Backup completed successfully",
  "success": true,
  "filename": "backup_2025-11-14_10-30-15.json",
  "filePath": "/path/to/backup/backup_2025-11-14_10-30-15.json",
  "statistics": {
    "AppSettings": 1,
    "Users": 5,
    "AttributeCategory": 3,
    "AttributeItem": 10,
    "Orders": 25,
    "Customers": 15,
    "Suppliers": 8,
    "InventoryItems": 50,
    "CustomerAddress": 20
  }
}
```

**Option 2: Via CLI Script**

```bash
npm run backup
```

Both methods will:
1. Query all entities and their relationships from InstantDB
2. Encrypt the data using AES-256-GCM with `BACKUP_PASSWORD`
3. Create a `backup/` folder in the project root (if it doesn't exist)
4. Generate an encrypted JSON file named `backup_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.json`
5. Return/display statistics about the backed up data

### Restore from Backup

```bash
npm run restore ./backup/backup_2025-11-14_10-30-00.json
```

This will:
1. Read the specified backup file
2. Decrypt the data using `BACKUP_PASSWORD` from `.env`
3. Show a 3-second warning before proceeding
4. Restore all entities in dependency order
5. Re-establish all relationships/links
6. Process links in batches to handle large datasets

## Backup File Structure

Backup files are encrypted using AES-256-GCM. The encrypted file structure:

```json
{
  "encrypted": "hex-encoded-encrypted-data",
  "iv": "hex-encoded-initialization-vector",
  "authTag": "hex-encoded-authentication-tag",
  "algorithm": "aes-256-gcm"
}
```

The decrypted data contains:

```json
{
  "timestamp": 1700000000000,
  "entities": {
    "AppSettings": [...],
    "Users": [...],
    "AttributeCategory": [...],
    "AttributeItem": [...],
    "Orders": [...],
    "Customers": [...],
    "Suppliers": [...],
    "InventoryItems": [...],
    "CustomerAddress": [...]
  },
  "links": {
    "AttributeCategoryItem": [...],
    "CustomerOrder": [...],
    "UserOrder": [...],
    "InventoryItemSupplier": [...],
    "InventoryItemAttribute": [...],
    "CustomerCustomerAddresses": [...]
  }
}
```

## Important Notes

- 🔒 **Backup files are encrypted** - you MUST have the correct `BACKUP_PASSWORD` to restore
- ⚠️ The restore process uses `update()` operations, so it will update existing records with matching IDs
- ⚠️ Make sure your `.env` file has valid `INSTANT_APP_ID`, `INSTANT_ADMIN_TOKEN`, and `BACKUP_PASSWORD`
- ⚠️ Large databases may take time to restore due to batch processing
- ✅ Encryption uses AES-256-GCM (authenticated encryption)
- ✅ The `backup/` folder is gitignored by default

## Security

- Backup files are encrypted using **AES-256-GCM** (Galois/Counter Mode)
- Password is hashed using **SHA-256** to derive the encryption key
- Each backup uses a unique random **initialization vector (IV)**
- **Authentication tags** prevent tampering with encrypted data
- Keep your `BACKUP_PASSWORD` secure and backed up separately

## Troubleshooting

**Error: BACKUP_PASSWORD environment variable is not set**
- Add `BACKUP_PASSWORD=your-secure-password` to your `.env` file
- Make sure the `.env` file is in the project root

**Error: Failed to decrypt backup. Please check that BACKUP_PASSWORD is correct**
- Verify you're using the same password that was used to create the backup
- Check for typos in the `.env` file

**Error: Invalid backup file format**
- The backup file may be corrupted
- Make sure you're using a file created by this script
- Don't manually edit backup files

**Error: Backup file not found**
- Check that you're providing the correct path to the backup file
- Use relative or absolute paths

**Error: Missing environment variables**
- Ensure `.env` file exists in project root
- Verify `INSTANT_APP_ID`, `INSTANT_ADMIN_TOKEN`, and `BACKUP_PASSWORD` are set

**Restore seems slow**
- This is normal for large datasets
- Links are processed in batches of 100 to avoid timeouts
- Progress is shown for each batch
